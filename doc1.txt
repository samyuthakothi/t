**Q**:Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.
 Ans:---
Data Type:It specifies the type of data that variable can hold.

Primitive Data types:these are the predifined data types by the programming languages and these are mutable
Integer :  It Stores whole numbers.
Ex: int age = 25;
Float:  It Stores decimal numbers.
Ex: float price = 19.99;
Character :  It Stores a single character.
Ex: char grade = 'A';
Boolean :  It Stores true or false values.
Ex: bool isRaining = false;
String :  It Represents a sequence of characters .
Ex: String name = "Alice".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Non-Primitive Data types:These are  derived from primitive types and are used to store collections of values, objects, or more complex data structures.
Arrays: Collection of elements of the same type.
Ex: int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};
Interfaces:  It Defines the contract of methods that implementing classes must provide.
Ex:
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}
Enumerations (enum):  It is used to define a fixed set of constants.
